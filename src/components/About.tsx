    <p className="max-w-3xl text-neutral-300">
      I&apos;m a motivated full-stack web developer pursuing a BSc in Computing
      and Information Systems at Daffodil International University, with
      hands-on experience in React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. I
      co-founded an e-learning platform, served as Treasurer of the DIU CIS
      Club, and developed projects like Items and Ideas, an Amazon-affiliated
      site for an Upwork client. Participating in global competitions such as
      NASA Space App Challenge, the ICPC, and various hackathons has enhanced my
      problem-solving skills. I&apos;m also exploring AI and IoT to build
      real-world solutions that drive innovation in technology.
